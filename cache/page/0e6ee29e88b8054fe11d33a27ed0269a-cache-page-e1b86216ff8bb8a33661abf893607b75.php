			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>In 2011, GADDIEL</strong> was founded with the aim to</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide industrial exposure to interns and fresher and help them to be industry ready at course completion</li>
<li>Provide IT solutions to segments of society that cannot afford costly solutions and are yet to exploit benefits of IT</li>
<li>Provide mobile solutions to small and medium enterprises to stay competitive</li>
<li>Provide real-time information to such small and medium enterprises to help them serve their customers better</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the last 4 years, Gaddiel has developed solutions and applications for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and even large companies.</p>
<p>From a humble start of helping fresher to get industrial exposure, we have leveraged the rich experience of the founders to enter into solution provisioning.  With a core young team we have entered into unknown waters and developed solutions to cater to different segments.  We believe this was possible only through “<strong>Customer Focused Growth Strategies</strong>”.</p>
<p>We have gained expertise in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile Application development using tools to code once and deploy anywhere</li>
<li>Enterprise Solutions</li>
<li>Consulting and Project Executions</li>
<li>Java Based Applications</li>
<li>Full-Stack Java Script Solutions</li>
<li>XAMP Stack</li>
<li>Tap and Go Technologies - QR Code / NFC</li>
</ul>]]></description>
